        <h3> Let's talk about Sadza!!</h3>

        <p> I am Zimbabwean,so we'll obviously start with Sadza. Sadza, Zimbabwe's staple food, embodies tradition and resilience.
            Made from maize meal, it nourishes and comforts for generations.
            Boiling water and maize meal blend, forming a thick porridge.
            Shared in communal bowls, fostering warmth and togetherness.
            Enjoyed with diverse relishes, adding flavors to its hearty embrace.
            Scooping with hands, creating unity around the table.
            Sadza symbolizes resilience, community, and familial ties.
            A cultural treasure, it unites and strengthens through shared meals. </p>

                <h4>Here is  how you can make your own sadza:</h4>

                <p>
                    <ol>
                        
                        <li>Boil Water: Start by bringing a pot of water to a rolling boil on the stove. The amount of water will depend on the quantity of sadza you want to make.</li>
                    <li>Gradually Add Maize Meal: Slowly sprinkle maize meal into the boiling water while stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or whisk. The maize meal should be added in small amounts to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
                    <li>Stir Vigorously: Keep stirring the mixture vigorously to ensure even cooking and prevent clumping. It requires some strength and effort to properly mix the maize meal with the water.</li>
                    <li>Adjust Consistency: Continue stirring and adding maize meal until the mixture thickens to a smooth, thick porridge-like consistency. The sadza should be thick enough to hold its shape but still be soft and smooth.</li>
                    
                    <li>Simmer and Cook: Once the desired consistency is reached, reduce the heat to low and let the sadza simmer for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking or burning.</li>
                    <li>Shape and Serve: Remove the pot from the heat and use a wooden spoon to shape the sadza into a smooth mound or serve it directly from the pot. Traditionally, it is shaped into a round or oval mound in a communal bowl.</li>

                    <li>Accompany with Relishes: Sadza is typically served with various relishes, such as vegetables, meat, or fish. These relishes can be cooked separately and served alongside the sadza.</li>

                    <li>Enjoy: Sadza is traditionally eaten by taking a small portion with your hand, rolling it into a ball, and using it to scoop up the relish. It is best enjoyed while hot and shared with family or friends.</li>
                    </ol>
